# Message Generator Program
This program will output a randomized message every time it is run. That message will consist of at least three different pieces of data.

## To Do List:
  * Create the message
  * Store message components
  * Create script and run it locally
  * Put the program together
  * Bonus points

## Topic:
the program will generate a Fantasy world character (think DnD or video game) sheet
This character sheet will include some basic stats, a name, and a short bio (enlist ChatGPT to write a few?)

the output will start with a name followed by a short bio then the stats for the character generated.

### Stats:
  * Luck (has an affect on all other rolls)
  * Strength
  * Vitality (for health)
  * Intelligence
  * Wisdom (for focus)
  * Charisma
