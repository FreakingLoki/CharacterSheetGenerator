# Message Generator Program
This program will output a randomized message every time it is run. That message will consist of at least three different pieces of data.

## To Do List:
  * Put the program together
  * Bonus points

## Topic:
the program will generate a Fantasy world character (think DnD or video game) sheet
This character sheet will include some basic stats, a name, and a short bio (enlist ChatGPT to write a few?)

the output will start with a name followed by a short bio then the stats for the character generated.

### Stats:
  * Name
  * Biography
  * Luck (has an affect on all other rolls)
  * Strength
  * Vitality (for health)
  * Dexterity
  * Agility (for stunts)
  * Intelligence
  * Wisdom (for focus)
  * Charisma

  #### Vitality, Agility, and Wisdom
  Vitality and wisdom are both tied to their "parent" stats. so vitality (or health, stamina, etc.) is heavily influenced by the character's strength. Wisdom (or mana, focus, etc.) is heavily influenced by the character's intelligence. This is done to ensure that a character with high strength and low intelligence does not end up with more wisdom than vitality. Agility works in the same fashion, influenced by Dexterity.
